Let me tell you something: I’ve tasted a lot of coffee. Some slap you in the face like Batman interrogating a goon. Others whisper sweet nothings and leave you wondering if you even drank anything. Rave Mbili Twiga Nº 291? This stuff waltzes in wearing a three-piece suit, gives you a smouldering stare, and then—bam!—hits your taste buds with a monologue of flavour.

First sip: prune—but not your grandma’s prunes. I’m talking rich, velvety, handsome prunes. The kind that wear a leather jacket and read Nietzsche.

Then there’s black tea. Not the bag-in-a-mug, sad-office-breakroom type. No, this is James Bond at high tea in Dar es Salaam, pinky raised, enemies watching.

And finally: treacle. Dark, mysterious, and so seductive it probably has a secret identity.

The roast? Smooth. Confident. Balanced like a Nolan film plotline—complex, but not trying too hard to be clever. “Korongo” means flamingo, and somehow this coffee does strut like a bird that knows it’s pretty, but has also read Hemingway.

In summary: this isn’t your average cup. This is a mood, a moment, a supporting character in the biopic of your morning. And at £8.95, it’s cheaper than therapy and twice as enlightening.
