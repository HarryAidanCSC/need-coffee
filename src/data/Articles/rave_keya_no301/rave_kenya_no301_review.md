I’ve been a big fan of Rave since signing up to their subscription in early May. I'm now on my third bag, and this might just be my favourite yet. I generally find myself leaning towards a lighter roast these days, but this dark Kenyan AB Asali may have just flipped the script. 

We have here a speciality grade coffee from Nyeri County in Kenya. I’ll preface this review with the fact that I am a devout, AeroPressed black coffee drinker at home - sorry to any milk fans out there.

The first cup I tasted in Tuesday's early hours may have been my best home brew yet. Having just finished a sweet breakfast, following up with this coffee was a genius move (if you can pair it with a pastry or even some cereal, you’re in for a treat). We’ve got a full-bodied, caramelly profile with this one. As someone who’s generally tasted South American beans, I will definitely be trying some more from Africa in the near future. 

In all fairness, as much as I loved this coffee, you are paying a pretty penny to get hold of it at £8.95 per 250g bag. As an amateur coffee drinker, I would find it difficult to tell you the complex distinctions between a similar coffee that is perhaps a few pounds cheaper. But let's be honest, at the very least you’re getting one hell of a delicious placebo effect, and at worst, a great-tasting bag of coffee. 

This gets a full 5-star review. For helping reignite my enthusiasm for darker roasted coffee and a delicious profile, I would highly recommend picking this up.
