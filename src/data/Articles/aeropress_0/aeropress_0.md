The famous AeroPress, conceived by Adam Adler in 2005, since becoming one of the most popular brewing methods across the world. If you've never heard of this thing before, get ready for a life-changing experience. For those of you who only have the attention span to read this far down, I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking at brewing coffee at home.

So how do we use this thing? Pop a filter paper into the basket, attach it to the main body, grind your beans (or use pre-ground beans - we don't mind here), pour them into the AeroPress, fill with water, and press away! Fantastic coffee in under 2 minutes without any of the gritty sludge and long wait associated with a cafetière. 

If you're like me and prefer a strong cup, the AeroPress is going to beat out any cafetière or drip coffee out there - both of which have their merits. Now, I will admit that I have rarely tried coffee brewed with either a Moka pot or pour-over; however, I can clean my AeroPress in 20 seconds under the tap, quicker than any alternative unless you're the Flash.

So we have strong, fast, and tasty coffee in just a couple of minutes. Sounds like a poor man's espresso machine, right? To some extent - yes. This thing cost me about £25 compared to £100 for even the cheapest espresso machine on the market. I'll take the poor man's option any day...

Let's keep things sensible; this won't give you an espresso shot like a fancy electric machine will, and you're making one cup at a time. Good luck serving a coffee to a room full of people with one of these. However, for a quick, tasty cup for myself in the morning, it is perfect. Machine-washable, compact, and cheap. 

You might have heard the expression "skill floor" and "skill ceiling" before. If not, just understand that you do not need experience in coffee to be effective at this thing. If you think that means there is no room to experiment and flex your brewing skills, take a look at any one of the 60 national AeroPress competitions each year...

A truly brilliant tool. At its price point I would highly recommend adding it to your brewing arsenal.
