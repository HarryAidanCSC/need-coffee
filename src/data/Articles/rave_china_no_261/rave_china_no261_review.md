Let’s not beat around the Chemex — China Dongka Nº 261 isn’t just a coffee, it’s an experience. The kind of brew that walks into your kitchen at 7am, adjusts its cufflinks, and says: "You look like you need saving, sunshine."

First off, yes — China. And if that surprised you, welcome to the future. Rave’s partnership with Indochina and Yunnan Coffee Traders has unlocked a flavour profile so elegant it practically bowed before entering my mug.

The aromatics? Like tea, but if tea had dreams of being a jazz musician and finally made it to the big stage. Delicate, floral, and slightly mysterious — like that one girl at the bar who reads Murakami and makes eye contact once.

Then come the flavours:

Citrus – not the screechy, sour kind. This is orchestral citrus, smooth and purposeful, like a lemon that went to finishing school.

Almond – subtle, creamy, like a background character that suddenly wins an Oscar.

Brown sugar – rich and cozy, but not clingy. The kind of sweetness that calls you “darling” and means it.

This coffee is vibrant, clean, and sweet—kind of like if Christian Bale’s Bruce Wayne took a vacation to Yunnan, discovered enlightenment, and came back with a Chemex instead of a Batmobile.

Bottom line: Dongka Nº 281 doesn’t need to shout. It just shows up, takes your hand, and calmly rewrites your idea of what Chinese coffee can be.
