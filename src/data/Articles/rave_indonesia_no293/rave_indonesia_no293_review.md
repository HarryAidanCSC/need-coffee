Alright, let’s get into it.

Wahana Estate No.191 walks in with swagger — it’s from Indonesia, it’s estate-grown, it probably knows a thing or two about volcanic soil and artisanal fermentation. It wants to be the hero your morning deserves… but let’s be honest, it’s not quite Bruce Wayne — it’s more like that well-dressed guy in the boardroom who’s technically competent but never gets the girl.

The aroma? Earthy, woody, slightly mysterious — like the jungle floor after a tropical rain. Promising stuff. You lean in. You sip. And then… meh.

It’s interesting — yes. Complex? Arguably. But balanced? That’s where things start to wobble.

What’s good:
That deep, brooding base — classic Indonesian body, syrupy and low-acid.

Notes of dried fruit, cedar, maybe even a hint of tobacco — like it’s been aged in a wise old library somewhere near Lake Toba.

But here’s the rub:
It lacks spark. That flavour crescendo you’re hoping for? It never quite arrives. The finish? A little flat. Like a monologue that trails off mid-sentence.

If you don’t dial in the brew perfectly, it can turn muddy, even murky. The kind of cup that says "rustic" but ends up just tasting confused.

Let’s not be unfair — Wahana No.191 has merit. It’s just not the leading role. It’s the gritty side character with potential that never quite lands the punchline. Worth trying? Absolutely. Worth raving about? Maybe not without a bit of Batcave-level brew tuning.
